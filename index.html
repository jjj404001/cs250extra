    <h1>JJJ's Planar shadow derivation.</h1>
	<h2>Intersection between ray and plane.</h2>
	<p>To explane about shadow projections, I will start from very basics.</p>
	<p>Basically, the dot product of two perpendicular vectors are 0,</p>
	<p>because result from dot product is length of projection.</p>
	<p>So if there are origin of plane p0 and point on plane p and normal vector n of plane exist,</p>
	<img src="images/vectors_on_plane.png">
	<p>It should looks like this, we already know that a dot product of two perpendicular vectors are 0,</p>
	<p>and actually, point p is intersection point between plane and ray.</p>
	<p>We can evaluate this shared point between plane and ray using parametric equation of ray and plane.</p>
	<i>n&middot;ray + d = 0</i>
	<p>The equation of plane using point-normal form will looks like this after we insert intersection point to the equation.</p>

	<p></p>
	<i>n&middot;(P0 + t(P -L)) + d = 0, where t > 0</i>
	<i>n&middot;t(P -L) = -n&middotP0 -d</i>
	<i>t = <sup>-n&middotP0 -d</sup>/<sub>(P-L)n</sub>
	<p>Now we know how to get intersection point between ray and plane, it is time to cast some shadow, but I will start with easy one.</p>
	<h2>Case 1: directional light source.</h2>
	<img src="images/directional.png">
	<p>For directional shadow, we can use calculated t value with parametric equation of ray.
	<i>s = p - (<sup>n&middot;p+d</sup> / <sub>n&middot;L</sub>)L
